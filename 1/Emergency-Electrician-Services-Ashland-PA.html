Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
