Don't forget to keep your appliances away from water, check for correct wattage light bulbs, and check the insulation on a cord. There is no point in time at which the light source ceases to function; instead, LEDs gradually degrade in performance over time. If you want to add more lights, you may need a bigger transformer; if so, it's probably more economical to buy a whole new system in a kit.</p>
