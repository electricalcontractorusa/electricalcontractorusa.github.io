After your service panel is upgraded, there's a step you can take to get even higher performance from your home electric system. Generally, yellow colored wirings are used as switch legs for controlling units such as fans, light and other outlets that require switches. If you aren't sure if your home has 220 volt service, call up your utility company, or have an electrician come take a look.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible.
