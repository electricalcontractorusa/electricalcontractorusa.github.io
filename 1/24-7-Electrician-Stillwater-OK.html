The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>
<p>The most common cause of portable generators failing to produce electricity is from the loss of residual magnetism. With punctual staff, high-quality work and a high attention to detail, our Denver electricians can solve any type of electrical emergency.
