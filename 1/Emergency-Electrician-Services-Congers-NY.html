Also, within the broad CII category, commercial construction is the top money maker at 26.7 percent of revenue, versus 13.6 percent for industrial projects and 8.6 percent for institutional work. In many older homes, the circuitry is hooked into a fuse box as its primary control panel.</p>
<p>However a number of traditions associated with domestic electrical wiring in the UK still differ significantly from other countries including ring circuits, fused plugs, switch sockets, absence of normal switches and sockets in bathrooms, historic wiring colours and asymmetric supply-voltage tolerances.
