<p>Changing an electrical service panel isn't like changing a fuse or wiring a new ceiling fan. An electrical surge is an unexpected and uncontrolled spike in voltage on an electrical circuit. Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen. If you are like most people, you are probably aware of some basic electrical knowledge, such as knowing how to flip a breaker and that water and electricity don't mix, but there's also a lot you probably don't know.</p>

Your electrical panel controls all the electricity in your home. Furthermore, installing an electrical landscape lighting system is more complicated, requires various components, and offers less flexibility when comparable outside solar garden lights. Changeable light switches just as you like.</p>
