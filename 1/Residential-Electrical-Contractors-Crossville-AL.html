Low voltage outdoor lights are also less likely to cause hazardous electrical sparks or currents.</p>
<p>Turn the power off at the circuit breaker. If you find yourself using extension cords very often, consider having an electrician install new outlets throughout your home. What this rating means is that it can handle greater surges than devices with a lower In rating.
