Or, you can show proof of completing a 2-year training course of approximately 576 hours and pass an exam.

In a building whose lights (or other devices) are controlled by a low-voltage system, one or more of these 120VAC electrical circuits will power one or more low voltage transformers that in turn will provide low voltate (24VAC) to operate switches and relays controllilng the building lighting system.</p>
<p>A circuit is a single line of wire starting at the service panel and running through the house to serve multiple outlets.
