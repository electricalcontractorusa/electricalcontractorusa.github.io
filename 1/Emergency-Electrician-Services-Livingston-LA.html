Standby generators are permanently mounted, do not require power cords and can carry a much larger load than their portable counterparts.

These systems commonly use a transformer or power supply to convert 120 volts from an outdoor receptacle outlet to a lower voltage at the secondary of the power supply. When lightning strikes near a power line, it increases the current flow along that line a million volts, possibly more.</p>
