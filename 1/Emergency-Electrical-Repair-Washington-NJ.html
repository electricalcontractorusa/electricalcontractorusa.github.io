Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired. Yes, but it would have to be a three-way switch and wired in a completely radical way with additional wires between the switch and outlet.

Because having a grounding wire and grounded (three-pronged) outlets adds an extra level of safety, newer houses and buildings are required to have three-pronged outlets with grounding wires. I do not suggest that you remove the breaker panel cover which will show all the wiring from the circuits, but you could turn the breaker off to a room and remove the cover plates to the light switches and receptacles and loosen the screws that hold them in the electrical box.</p>
<p>Check that all appliances and electric equipment are located away from the sink and bath. We can help you do this when you call us to learn more about the generators we can install for you.
