<p>Lights, like all sources of electricity, can also cause electric shock, so ensure you always turn the light switch off before replacing a light bulb, and never replace a light bulb or touch a light switch with wet hands. Whole house surge protection is a great way to ensure that the valuable appliances and equipment in your home are protected from the damaging effects of electrical spikes from the electrical utility provider and lightning strikes.

Even if you turn off power, electrical wiring can be tricky and is best left to the professionals. The TLC folks promptly responded and scheduled a time to repair or replace right away.</p>
<p>Never use them with extension cords. Choosing the right emergency electrician can be a very difficult decision to make especially if you are facing a stressful situation. Any electrical contractor that you hire should be technically proficient, reputable, and financially stable, and should demonstrate a thorough understanding of your business.
