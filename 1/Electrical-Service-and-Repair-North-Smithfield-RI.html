<p>These fuse boxes worked fine for small homes that didn't use much electricity, but today's electrical usage (with air conditioners, furnaces, and so on) require a higher electrical capacity. The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>Install your outdoor low voltage lighting system and enjoy the rewards. And they cannot carry the electrical current that a copper wire with the same size can.
