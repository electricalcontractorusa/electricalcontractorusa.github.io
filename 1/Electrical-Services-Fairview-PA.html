<p>Some older equipment and wiring appeared well-maintained, performing effectively and safely. There are some simple steps homeowners can take to protect their families and homes from electrical hazards.

<p>That means that each light contains a specifically designed solar collection panel that gathers energy during the day, stores it up in rechargeable batteries, and then uses that energy to power the lights at night. Our goal is to help you, our customers, add elegance and beauty to your surroundings by accenting the natural features of your home and lawn through the use of decorative outdoor lighting while remaining conscious of price and quality. When you turn on a power hog like an air conditioner or your computer it creates a power surge to "kick start" it. This can cause internal damage to the equipment.</p>
