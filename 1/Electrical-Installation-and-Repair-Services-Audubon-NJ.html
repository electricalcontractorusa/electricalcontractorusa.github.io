<p>Both these types of switches use the same front finger plate; the only different is the back box. Electricians often keep full-time schedules and might work overtime. In some cases, you may need a license in order to work as an employee of an electrical contractor. For electrical contractors, the challenges are clear. They stop surges right at your incoming services before they can travel down the power, cable and telephone lines damaging your equipment.

<p>Before this change, old wiring colours in the UK for 2-core wire were red = live, black = neutral and earths are either bare or yellow and green, whereas with 3-core cable live = red, blue = neutral, additional = yellow and earth either bare or yellow and green. Be wary of any electrical contractor who agrees to do any major electrical work, such as rewiring a house, without pulling the proper local building permits. A business could end up with an electrician who does not have the experience necessary to meet their electrical needs, or an inexperienced homeowner can end up with a contractor who takes too long and costs too much.</p>

This entails the same preparation as the T-connector method, except you lay the cable from the transformer, along side each light fixture (one cluster per cable), and back to the transformer. A surge protector should have protections from overheating, but if you ever feel that it's hot to the touch, replace it.

<p>You could even add half hot outlets by using a 3 rope wire with black, red, white and green if you would like to. Two of my living room outlets, for instance, are operated from the same switch. I have another neighbor who leaves several safety lights on all night long. These tasks, though important, are only one of the many electricians might tackle. This includes all residential and commercial services, from bonding and grounding to generator installation and repair.</p>
