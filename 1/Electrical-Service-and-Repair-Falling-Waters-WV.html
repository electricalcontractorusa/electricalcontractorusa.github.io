Lighting can be incorporated into your landscape in a variety of ways, but the fun is in creating a unique look that reflects your own personal taste and lifestyle.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors.
