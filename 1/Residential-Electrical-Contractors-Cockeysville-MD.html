ElectriCall, LLC has been providing electrical services to families, individuals, and businesses since 2011.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
