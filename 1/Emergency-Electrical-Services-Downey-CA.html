<h3>What Is an Electrical Contractor? - Facts You Must Know in Downey CA</h3>
<p>Frequently moving fixtures around can result in damage to the lights themselves. While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose. Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) reports there are an average of 50,000 home electrical fires each year, causing $1.3 billion in property damage and almost 1,400 injuries and 500 deaths.

Due to an ever-increasing requirement for improving energy conservation efforts and the importance that this initiative will have on our future and well-being, it makes sense that by using these lower voltage lights and saving more energy that you can also take part in helping with the conservation goals needed to prevent using up our valuable energy resources or to continue rapidly depleting them.</p>
<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service.
