While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode."

Installing the right size gas line with proper connectors is very important to the proper function of your generator and a poorly installed gas line will prevent your generator from starting. Afterward, you can rest assured knowing that your home will always have a reliable source of electricity no matter what emergency situation occurs. If the motor starter line circuits are clear, the problem is on the load side of the starter.</p>
<p>This is one of the largest Generac generators available, which provides home & business owners with the best value per kilowatt available in the market today. The panel determines how much power is available for distribution from the circuits to the appliances, lights, and outlets. An external solar panel allows he homeowner to position the panel in direct sunlight while positioning the solar fixture in a shaded area. Then connect the black hot wire coming from power to the brass screw.</p>
