<p>A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor.

If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
