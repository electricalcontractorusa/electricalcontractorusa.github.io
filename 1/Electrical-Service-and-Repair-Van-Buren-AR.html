While an electrical panel can last for as much as 50 years or more, it's generally considered safe practice to replace it every 25 years. First remove or repair any loose electrical lines. From tamper-resistant receptacles to GFCI (Ground Fault Current Interrupter) outlets, there are now safer electrical options that you might want to consider including in your home.</p>
