<p>In other words - don't continue using an aging, defective electrical panel or cuicut breaker in your home. With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes. Or maybe it's something bad, like a new electrical contractor opened up in your town and hired away some of your best people. Don't run extension cords under the rug or carpet. Electricians train to handle a wide variety of issues with electrical power, lighting and control systems.</p>
<p>Some electricians — especially those who haven't been around for a while or who aren't really savvy with the code — will steer customers in a different direction just for not having the correct knowledge,” Volpe says.

This should be handled professionally as it involves permits, building codes, and professional electrical, plumbing and potentially gas line work if your power source is natural gas. When you're pulling power from a source other than a receptacle (such as a light fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and receptacle will need to be arc-fault circuit interrupter ( AFCI ) protected.</p>
