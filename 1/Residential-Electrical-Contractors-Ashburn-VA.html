<p>Automatic transfer switches give homeowners a seamless transition of power whenever the main power is lost. This entails the same preparation as the T-connector method, except you lay the cable from the transformer, along side each light fixture (one cluster per cable), and back to the transformer. A surge protector should have protections from overheating, but if you ever feel that it's hot to the touch, replace it.

The farther your lights are from this transformer, the dimmer they are going to be.
