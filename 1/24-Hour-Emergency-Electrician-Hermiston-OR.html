We offer both repair and replacement services , and we'll discuss the pros and cons of each option to help you make the decision that is best for your situation. Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>
<p>It is important to repair or replace old or damaged electrical wiring before it becomes a hazard. Extension cords are intended for temporary use.

When mounting a light switch over a countertop—for example, in an indoor or outdoor kitchen, an art studio, or a craft room—reduce the standard wall mounting height to 40 inches.
