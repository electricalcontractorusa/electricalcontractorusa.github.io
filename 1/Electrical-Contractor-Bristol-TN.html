Furthermore, when low voltage fixtures need maintenance, the skill of that labor to understand the system and identify where a transformer that's powering a low voltage fixture is could come at a premium. It is most common to put the red wire on the bottom screw, since that will make the top plug-in "hot" at all times and will be a little easier to plug things into it. A spool of cable is what you see at the home center, and here in the United States it normally will contain two insulated wires and an uninsulated bare copper ground wire.</p>
