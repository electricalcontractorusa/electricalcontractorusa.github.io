<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>Personalized Service: Our technicians will inspect your home and determine the correct generator needed to power all your appliances and systems. They can be installed in the ground to uplight statues, fountains, flag poles, trees, or your company logo. As long as you take note which wires go to which terminal and copy this arrangement to the new switch, everything should work correctly.

Landscape lighting designers usually charge from $200 up to $500 to come with a detailed plan and illustrations for either your DIY guidance or contractor use.</p>
