While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired. Yes, but it would have to be a three-way switch and wired in a completely radical way with additional wires between the switch and outlet.
