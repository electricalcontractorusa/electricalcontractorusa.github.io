The first thing that you're going to want to do and this is the most important, is to make sure that the electricity they shut off, to the light fixture that you are about to be working on. Most of the time, this would simply require making sure that the light switch that operates the ceiling fixture, is turned to the off position.</p>

Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible. Setting up landscape lighting is a good idea when establishing the boundaries of an outdoor path.</p>
