Needless to say this is much more than you will probably need for most of your home outdoor lighting projects.</p>
<p>All of your computer equipment, laptops, printers, plasma TV, LCD, or tube type televisions, surround sound systems, security systems and any other sensitive electronic devices are things that need surge protection.

It could damage the electrical system in your house or even cause a fire. Sometimes, these outlets can even start small electrical fires.</p>
