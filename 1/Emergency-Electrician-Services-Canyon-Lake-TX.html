<p>Although these technologies are relatively new, a licensed electrician can install them at a minimal cost in homes with aging electrical systems. Check and replace any electrical components that have worn, cracked or frayed cords and only use appliances in good condition. No cover plate on the electrical box. A licensed master electrician, fire alarm specialist, or sign specialty technician in combination with a contractor license may also work as a self-employed electrical, fire alarm, or sign contractor providing even further opportunities.</p>
