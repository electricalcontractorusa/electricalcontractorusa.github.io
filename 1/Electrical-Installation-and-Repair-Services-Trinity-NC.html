<p>The problem is that a GFCI monitors the current on the neutral and hot wires; when they are unbalanced it will trip. In new construction, GFCI receptacles are required by code where electricity and water are in close proximity, as in the bathroom, kitchen, garage, swimming pool area, crawl-space, unfinished basement, or on exterior outlets.
