<p>To better identify electric problems, one should know first what a consumer unit is and the switches that go along with it. Basically, the consumer unit is responsible for electrical distribution in the panels installed at home. Many older homes use fuse boxes to govern electricity, but upgrading to a circuit breaker panel will make your home more efficient and lessen the chance of an electrical fire. When you choose a whole-home generator, you'll not only be able to keep the lights on, but also run major appliances, like your refrigerator, during an outage.</p>
