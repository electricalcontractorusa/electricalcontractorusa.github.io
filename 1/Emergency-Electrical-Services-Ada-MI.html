<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>
<p>If you suddenly find yourself resetting the breakers several times a week when you rarely needed to reset them before, then this could be a good time to schedule a home electrical safety check and get the panel repaired or replaced. Generators come in two basic designs: standby generators and portable generators. Every house can create their own power through electric generators.
