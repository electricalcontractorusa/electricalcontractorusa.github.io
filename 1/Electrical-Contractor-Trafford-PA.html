No idea if the existing light has a xformer separate from the fixture, or if it's built in. The install is on the first floor, no attic space. Thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge when used for controlling low-voltage lighting relays or thermostats, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls.</p>
<h2>Home Lighting Design in Trafford Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Instead of paying for repairs that almost justify buying new equipment; facilities can pay for repairs that cost far less in terms of parts and labor. As an electrician, you must hold a state license to work in Washington. The "normal" building electrical wires, typically #14 gauge (for 15-Amp circuits), is used to carry electrical power into and then out of the low-voltage relay and on to the light, electrical receptacle, or other device that the switch and relay are intended to control.</p>
