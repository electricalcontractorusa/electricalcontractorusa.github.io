Master Electrician: You need to have at least 5 years of experience, equaling 10,000 hours, in commercial, residential, or industrial work. This type of lighting gives less bright light than mains, but it is often still good enough to light up a path, bedding area, or even useful practical light if there are enough lights and they are near enough to where the light is wanted.</p>
