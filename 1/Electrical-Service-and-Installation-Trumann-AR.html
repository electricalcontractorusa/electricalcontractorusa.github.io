Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired. Yes, but it would have to be a three-way switch and wired in a completely radical way with additional wires between the switch and outlet.
