If you were to open your electrical panel or breaker box, which you'll typically find in your basement, garage, utility room, or a closet, you'll see rows of switches. Their main purpose is to protect the sensitive electronics and microprocessor based loads against residual lightning energy, motor generated surges and other internally generated surge events.
