<p>It is best, then, to have a professional install these low voltage landscape lights to minimize the risk of physical equipment damage. When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>
