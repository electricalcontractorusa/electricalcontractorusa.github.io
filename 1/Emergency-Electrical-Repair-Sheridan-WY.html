The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>Remember to be cautious about troubleshooting such light installations as these bulbs could be lead to potential danger. Power strips — or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics — are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances. Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>
