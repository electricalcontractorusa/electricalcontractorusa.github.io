<p>Cloth wiring is another very tricky topic for a lot of home inspectors, electricians, and insurance companies.

Friendly & Courteous - Our electricians will not swear or smoke in your home. It is basically the brain” of an electric system, and will have the power to shut off or on electricity to the entire home. My guess is that those black wires are the permanent hot and that the white is being used to provide a hot wire to the switch; the returning black from the switch is used to provide switched power to the outlet.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
