Consult an electrician, if necessary, to determine the exact size of circuit wiring to be sure that all circuits are properly protected against overloads.</p>

Low voltage landscape lighting helps people find paths and walkways in unfamiliar, dark territory and when installed in overhead features systems light up surfaces used for cooking and serving food, such as BBQs and tables.
