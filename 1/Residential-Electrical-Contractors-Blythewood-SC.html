One of the issues that occur in aluminum wiring is that whenever too much power goes through the aluminum wire it can expand up to three times its current size. The circuit is completed when the current is brought back into the outlet through the neutral slot, and back into the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible.
