<p>To prepare for major storms and power failures, invest in a home generator that will automatically provide power in those critical times. Before you actually start taking things apart and messing with wires, you need to shut off the power to the outlet by turning off the appropriate breaker at the breaker box.

For example, rust is one sign of water damage.
