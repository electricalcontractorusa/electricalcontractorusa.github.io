Location - The generator will need some space outdoors, often along the side or back of your property where electricity enters your home.</p>
<p>For safe wire connections, cut all the wires to leave at least 6 in. protruding past the face of the box.

The registration requirement applies to beginning electricians, electrical apprentices, industrial electrical apprentices, and residential electrical apprentices.
