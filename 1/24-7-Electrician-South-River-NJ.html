Homes with 120-volt service (the typical size) can use an 80kA-rated surge protector as surges over 50kA are unusual. Just like most things in a home, some elements of an electrical system need to be replaced from time to time, and this might include the electrical panel.</p>
<p>There are three protective devices that are designed to detect faults and quickly break the connection, helping to protect both your home from electrical fire, and your family from shock and electrocution.
