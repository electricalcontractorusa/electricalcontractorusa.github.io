<p>These fuse boxes worked fine for small homes that didn't use much electricity, but today's electrical usage (with air conditioners, furnaces, and so on) require a higher electrical capacity. The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting has the ability to transform even the most ordinary looking spaces into a dramatic area just by highlighting architectural features or landscape, while adding security and even value to your property.

<p>So look for one with at least an Underwriters Lab's rating of "UL1449" and labeled "Transient Voltage Surge Protector".

While regular and modern appliances need 100-200 amps or more amps of power, fuse boxes are only designed to handle 30-60 amps of power. Electricians in Wyoming must hold a state license to work.</p>
