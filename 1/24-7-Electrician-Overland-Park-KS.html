If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover.">

<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician in Overland Park</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel. TIP: If the wires to the power source are "plugged" into the back, then you can gently rock the power source back-and-fourth until they come free.</p>
<p>Remove the wall plate covering the existing switch by unscrewing the two screws. Electric current travels from point to point because there is a greater electric potential energy on one end of the wire than there is on the opposite end. When you're ready to schedule a service, give us a call at 804-329-1000 , and one of our commercial electricians will arrive at your property as soon as possible. We'll evaluate the safety of your electrical wiring system and take the appropriate steps to get your system up to speed.</p>
