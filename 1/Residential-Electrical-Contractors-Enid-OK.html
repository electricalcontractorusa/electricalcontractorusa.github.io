<p>Portable gas engine generators cost between $300-$2,500 and provide from 2,500-10,000 watts of emergency power. Backup home generators are the only reliable protection against a power outage. The wiring's thickness determines the brightness of all of your landscape lights. There may be no tell-tale signs of bad wiring, overloads, or surge damage, making professional electrical inspections so important. These wires are more effective in reducing electrical interference, which makes them efficient for telephone cabling.</p>
<p>Circuits are not designed to house two conductors, and one may come loose, overheat, arc, or even lead to a fire. With recessed lighting fixtures installed by a Sears Handyman, your home will enjoy a new touch of elegance that modern lighting provides.

Remember, when you are investing in your home, you are investing in its future worth, so take your time when choosing your outdoor lighting.</p>
