<p>Note: not all states offer a statewide journeyman electrician license. An electrical contractor can be the bridge between construction and design and actual functionality when you need your appliances and lights flipped back on. You'll eventually need to make several decisions about price, features, electrical capacity and other features, but the biggest overall choice is whether to buy a standby generator, a portable generator or an inverter generator.
