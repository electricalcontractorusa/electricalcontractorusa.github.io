<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>We will help you to decide on whether you should have your outdated fuse panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker panel. While they are very different to the typical home consumer, a fuse box serves the same role of a circuit breaker in a building: to prevent the overloading of circuits by cutting off the flow of power and reducing risk of fire.
