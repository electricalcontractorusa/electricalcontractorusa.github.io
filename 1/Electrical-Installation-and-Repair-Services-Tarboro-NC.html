Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more ‘layers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed. This is particularly true with a generator since the whole point is protecting your family during an already-stressful power outage.</p>
<p>GFCI breakers work by sensing differences in electricity that flows into a circuit, caused by contact with humans or water. While there are many different colors and types of materials being used within the solar lights, a flagstone pathway can be nicely illuminated with metal or copper lighting fixtures. However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace. If there is, try and add a short piece of black wire to the splice and put the other end onto the upper brass screw.</p>

This pergola stands on an island in the middle of a pond and is viewed from a distance, so rather than just lighting the structure itself, designer Dave Marciniak of Revolutionary Gardens uplit the crape myrtles on either side to spread the light across the entire feature.</p>
