Understanding of mathematical and scientific principles - While electricians don't need advanced mathematical and scientific skills, they will apply the basic principles of these disciplines to their work. Homeowners should expect to pay anywhere from $760 to $1,105 for new lighting installation throughout the interior.</p>
<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter outlet, or GFCI, is a circuit breaker outlet.
