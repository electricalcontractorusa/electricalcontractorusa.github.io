Cons: Home standby generators are pricier to buy, and installation costs can range from a few thousand dollars to $10,000 or more. Theory: Perhaps one set of Romex conductors from the outlet was connected to the switch before.” (This seems to be the case for the Family Room switched outlet.)

<p>Businesses that take on electrical projects in multiple states may need to obtain a license in each state where they have a project.
