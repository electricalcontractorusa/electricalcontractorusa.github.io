Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>

The LED bulbs are rated to last for over 10 years and only use 4.0 Watts of electricity per fixture on average compared to 2 years lifespan and 20 watts per bulb on a halogen system.

<p>For instance, pairing copper wire with aluminum wire can cause corrosion problems which cause the connection to become unstable. The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.‚Äù With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off. If you're concerned about protecting equipment while you're away or after office hours, look for surge protectors that completely cut off the power supply after a huge spike.</p>
<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt.

<h3>Electrical Contractor Duties and Responsibilities in Gladstone OR</h3>
<p>This voltage drop is why you're seeing your lights dim. Furthermore, when low voltage fixtures need maintenance, the skill of that labor to understand the system and identify where a transformer that's powering a low voltage fixture is could come at a premium.
