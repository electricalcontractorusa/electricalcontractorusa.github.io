A 100-amp breaker box may be sufficient for households with minimal use of electricity, but most modern homes require 200 amps. Note: Cast brass AMP¬Æ ONE fixtures feature a lifetime warranty. Nonetheless, it is still definitely worth consideration, especially by those who are looking for a portable home backup power generator running at no less than 15,000 watts. If rewiring becomes necessary, develop a wiring layout with help from local electrical specialists.</p>
