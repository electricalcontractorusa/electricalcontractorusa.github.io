Although a sturdy and robust item, generators do incur wear and tear and can sometimes fail. Beyond the standard outlet are outlets with a GFCI or AFCI circuit breaker, or both, in the same unit.

If you find electrical wires in your attic that are laying on top of the installation or you can see the plastic connectors, it wouldn't be a bad idea to call a local electrician to get some advice and see if there are any problems that need to be repaired.
