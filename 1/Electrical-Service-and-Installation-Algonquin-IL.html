When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>

<p>All generators mentioned on our list give you the option to choose between natural gas and liquid propane as fuel. More information about National Electrical Safety Month, including the complete 2012 NESM Toolkit and the How Do You Know?” program can be found on ESFI's Web site at -. With all of the wires reconnected and your new wire in place, carefully tuck the wires back into the electrical box. Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>
<p>These types of generators are adequate enough to power appliances such as refrigerators, furnaces, televisions, and sump pumps. Avoid planting trees underneath power lines or near utility equipment.

Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
