<p>You have probably seen the Type 3 and they're also called surge protected power strips. Peace of Mind Services also inspects and repairs generators of other brands including General Electric (GE), Caterpillar, and Cummins among others. Better-quality switches and outlets may cost a dollar or two more, but they're worth it. For starters, the components are better.
