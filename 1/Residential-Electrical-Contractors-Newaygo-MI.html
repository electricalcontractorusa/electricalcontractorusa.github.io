You can substitute up to 1,000 hours of experience for graduating from a two-year program at an approved electrical school. Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs. After completing this course, participants should be able to explain the basic principles of motor operation and describe the basic operation of a simple alternating current (AC) motor and a simple direct current (DC) motor.</p>
