<p>Cloth wiring is another very tricky topic for a lot of home inspectors, electricians, and insurance companies. Low-voltage transformers need an outlet that connects with your home's electrical system. Diesel powered generators are more durable and have a higher fuel efficiency.

Joe 'Connell Electrical Contracting has extensive experience in servicing all electrical needs associated with knob and tube wiring and would be happy to assist you as needed.</p>
