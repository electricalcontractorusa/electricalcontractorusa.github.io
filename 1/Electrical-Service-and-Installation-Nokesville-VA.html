<h2>LED Lighting in Nokesville Virginia</h2>
<p>These landscape lighting fixtures are designed to safely illuminate stairways and walkways. If you smell something fishy (literally), it could be a burning electrical outlet, switch, or other device. The neutral wire in the new switch box is capped with a wire nut unless it's needed for a smart switch or timer. As you add electrical wiring, you'll need another switch to control that part of the home. A surge protective device (SPD) is designed to protect electrical systems and equipment from surge and transient events by limiting transient voltages and diverting surge currents.</p>
