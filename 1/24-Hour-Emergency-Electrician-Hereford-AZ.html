Based on the 2014 requirements and the restrictions in Chapter 9 Tables 11(A) and 11(B), a small and simple low voltage lighting installation, such as those commonly installed under the kitchen cabinets, might require several Class 2 power supplies in order to comply with the code language and stay within the maximum power requirements for a Class 2 power supply.</p>
<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>
