We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable. Like a power strip, it provides extension outlets for your devices but its main job is to minimize the damage caused by random power fluctuations called power surges.</p>
<p>Test the lights; if they work correctly, bury the cable. Your family's safety is the utmost important factor to consider when deciding on whether or not to upgrade your home's electrical wiring. If an electrical ground is not located in the motor starter overload circuit, the problem has been isolated to the control circuit field wiring. If you've already purchased your standby generator , we can still perform a premium installation for your peace of mind. Even when opting for low voltage landscape lighting, be mindful of placing your landscape lights strategically to maximize both light emissions and ambience.</p>

Layout the fixtures on the ground first so you get the layout you want. If you answered yes to our questions above, or find that your current panel doesn't meet modern home electricity requirements, you may decide it's time for an upgrade. If we need to repair damaged wires, replace non-NEC compliant wires, or otherwise upgrade your dated two-prong to three-prong wall outlets, we can perform all of these services while we're at your home to repair your electrical panel.</p>
