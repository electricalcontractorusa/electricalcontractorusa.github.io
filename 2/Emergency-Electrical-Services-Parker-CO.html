Water and electricity can be lethal so it is more important to maintain electrical safety in the kitchen and bathroom. If you must be close to power lines, you must first call your electrical utility company and they will assist you.

<p>The light switch has thin stranded wires, so I tried my best to wrap them around the wall wiring before tightening the included wire nuts. If you find electrical wires in your attic that are laying on top of the installation or you can see the plastic connectors, it wouldn't be a bad idea to call a local electrician to get some advice and see if there are any problems that need to be repaired. Electricians travel each day to a job site, which may be new construction or an existing residential building, and may work alone or in teams depending on the size of the job.</p>
