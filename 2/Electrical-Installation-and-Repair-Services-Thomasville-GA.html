<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>The electrical panel or breaker emits a burning smell. As long as electricity is isolated, we can use it safely. And, here at Applegate, we provide quality standby generators from Generac®.
