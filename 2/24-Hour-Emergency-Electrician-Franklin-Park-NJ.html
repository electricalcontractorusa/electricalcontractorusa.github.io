You can substitute up to 1,000 hours of experience for graduating from a two-year program at an approved electrical school. Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs.

<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
