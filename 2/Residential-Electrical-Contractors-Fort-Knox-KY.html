<p>I have a half-hot outlet as you describe where half is always ready for plugin and the other half is off connected to a light switch. As compared to how nighttime light is seen, the day's lighting is different. Must carry ground wire, but does not have hazard of short circuit causing injury from shock. One circuit supplies the outlet that is controlled by a wall switch. Solar powered lighting has come a long way. BHEL is India's top power generation equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
