This change will alter the wiring coming into your home, meaning that the replacement breakers will not match the existing fuse sizes. Where a stationary generator would be required are situations where power must be restored immediately should an outage occur.</p>
<p>Most portable models run only on gasoline, though some come equipped to run on a propane tank or natural-gas line and others can be converted with kits. At Arrow Electric, we have over 20 years of experience and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, so we know electrical wiring like the back of our hands. Reputable electrical contractors have not only fulfilled the minimum training and experience required for licensing, but they also strive to maintain a high level of professional knowledge and performance throughout their careers.</p>

<p>The standby generator and the transfer switch are installed by a professional to the home's existing electrical wiring. When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible. Just answering the question as to whether you need the system to power the entire house or just emergency loads will help you determine the transfer switch size.</p>
<p>Wolf electricians have the expertise and experience needed to review your current panel and provide you with the best upgrade plan for your home and requirements. Electrical Contractor License: The Department of Community and Economic Development registration is required. Turn off all electrical appliances when you go out.

The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>
