<p>However, you are approaching the age threshold and we would recommend having an annual electrical inspection performed by either a certified home inspector or a licensed electrician. While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>This is different from the circuit panel illustration which reflects the long-standing practice of having a common neutral and ground tie block which was grounded at the house as well as at the transformer. Licenses and other communications from the Electricians' Examining Board will be sent to you by email, so please be sure to keep your contact information current. Our electricians always let our customer know what they are going to do - before star working on repairing.</p>
