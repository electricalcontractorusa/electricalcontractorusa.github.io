<p>Connecting the black hot wire to the neutral terminal of an outlet creates the potential for a lethal shock. Certificate renewal guidelines usually require an accumulation of X amount of electrician training hours within a year span. A DIY approach to crossing any light fitting, repair and wiring tasks of your home chore list are simply risky. Also, propane is available during outages when fuel pumps aren't working.
