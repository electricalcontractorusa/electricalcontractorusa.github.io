<p>As defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , a ''relay'' is "a device that is operated by a variation in the conditions of one electric circuit to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another electric circuit." A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.</p>
<p>But your homes outdoor lighting can be so much more than that. You can use a multimeter to test your electrical circuits and outlets.

During this review it was noted that the amplitude of the pole pass frequency in the CSA had increased for both of the motors powering the pump.</p>
<p>In that case the electrician may run a 14-2 wire (hot, neutral, ground) from the receptacle box to the switch, putting black tape on the ends of the white wire to show that BOTH wires are actually carrying current. This board licenses and regulates electrical contractors; registers qualified journeyman electricians; and is responsible for granting exemptions from licensure to persons or businesses engaged in telecommunications wiring in New Jersey.
