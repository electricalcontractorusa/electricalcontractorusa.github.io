There are many different types of electrical outlets, some of which are required for specific appliances. Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system. If your breaker box isn't functioning properly, it's very likely your home's appliances won't function properly either.</p>

Therefore, you want to experience a slight voltage drop to all lamps in your low voltage lighting system.

The simplest installation is one where the power source and new outlet are within the same wall segment but face opposite directions.</p>
<p>You are not going to see the immediate blow out that you would see if you had a major event like a lightning strike, but over time you'll begin to notice a difference in your devices like lights burning out quicker or speakers sounding funny.
