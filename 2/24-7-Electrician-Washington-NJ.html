Because LED lights are energy efficient, they are becoming more and more popular. Journeyman License: 4-year experience as an apprentice electrician is required. Yup, they're definitely not the cheapest in town, but I've used a few other plumbers over the years to try and save money, and inevitably they turned out to be less professional and sometimes downright shady, a few even causing issues that needed further work because of their ineptitude.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing your safety and security, landscape lighting is designed specifically for your home to highlight the beautiful areas and increase the value of your home. Since 1927, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has produced the Canadian Safety Standard for Electrical Installations, which is the basis for provincial electrical codes. The lighting can intimidate possible intruders to avoid trespassing on to your property.
