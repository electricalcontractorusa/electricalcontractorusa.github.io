The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>
<p>Caution needs taken if it is to be done from the switch box, however, as there will be a lot of wires in that box and a deep or oversize box will be required. Always err on the side of caution and seek the help of a licensed electrician. Before you go out and buy a bunch of landscape lighting fixtures, there are a few things that you need to do.
