<p>Consider installing tamper resistant (TR) outlets in homes with small children. Bulbs in these fixtures burn out quickly and do not produce sufficient light. Standby generators are permanently mounted, do not require power cords and can carry a much larger load than their portable counterparts. With highly trained electricians and fast, reliable service, we can inspect, upgrade, and replace your electrical panel to meet current codes and to protect your property from unexpected disaster.</p>

Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system. If your breaker box isn't functioning properly, it's very likely your home's appliances won't function properly either.</p>
<p>Attach the white to the unused terminal with the other white on the outlet and splice the ground to the ground going to the existing outlet, again with a short jumper so it can be re-attached back where it was.
