<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected. This is the preferred method of wiring a half-hot switched outlet, because if the power is coming from the switch, it is most likely a lighting circuit that is intended to operate lights, not outlets.</p>
<p>Or, a degree from an authorized electrical trade school, along with 2 years of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician. With these outlets and switches, some of the previous work simply confuses me. Having to cut out the back-stab connections is a frustration.
