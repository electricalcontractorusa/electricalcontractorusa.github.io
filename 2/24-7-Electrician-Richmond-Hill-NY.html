Lay the wires alongside the lights - but do not attach yet. The BLS reports that jobs for electrical contractors are expected to increase 23 percent between 2010 and 2020. Although circuit breakers and electrical panels are safer and more reliable than fuse boxes, they are still prone to problems now and again.</p>
