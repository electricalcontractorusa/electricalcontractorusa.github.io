<p>This page contains several diagrams for wiring a switch to control one or more receptacle outlets including a split receptacle and multiple outlets wired together. Engineers, production supervisors, maintenance supervisors, maintenance technicians, electricians, instrument technicians, and maintenance mechanics all need to have PLC and computer knowledge, training and skills in troubleshooting. A painful non-fatal shock may occur during the time that it takes for the GFCI to cut off the electricity so it is important to use the GFCI as an extra protective measure rather than a replacement for safe work practices.</p>
<p>The light switch has thin stranded wires, so I tried my best to wrap them around the wall wiring before tightening the included wire nuts. If you find electrical wires in your attic that are laying on top of the installation or you can see the plastic connectors, it wouldn't be a bad idea to call a local electrician to get some advice and see if there are any problems that need to be repaired. Electricians travel each day to a job site, which may be new construction or an existing residential building, and may work alone or in teams depending on the size of the job.</p>
