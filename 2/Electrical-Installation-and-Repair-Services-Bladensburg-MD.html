The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>
<p>At the same time, LED lights offer the option of brighter light to strongly illuminate certain areas. Voltage drop can occur from line loss over a long line of lights. That is exactly why we are proud to offer reliable emergency electrical services at all hours of the day.
