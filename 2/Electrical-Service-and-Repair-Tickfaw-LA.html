Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>

NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
