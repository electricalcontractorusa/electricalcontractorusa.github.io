<p>If your circuit breaker fails, it will not stop the flow of electricity when exposed to hazardous conditions. On the other hand, if you want your house to remain lit even during a power outage, you can opt for a small sized generator. PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>

Solar path lights are a great way to help reduce your energy usage. The Load terminals (red arrows near the top of our photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the outgoing wires. Even more impressive is the fact that this type of automated system will automatically switch back to the main electrical power supply when it has been restored.</p>
