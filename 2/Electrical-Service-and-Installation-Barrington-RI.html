The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.‚Äù With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off. If you're concerned about protecting equipment while you're away or after office hours, look for surge protectors that completely cut off the power supply after a huge spike.</p>
