It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>Upgrading an electrical panel is a serious endeavor that must be handled by a professional; this is not a DIY task. With todays technology, high voltage for landscape lighting is useless. Propane-fueled generators are often smaller than other types, and larger-sized models can be costly to acquire and run. The box with the switch in it thus has a "hot" wire, permanently hot, a neutral and a ground. The location of the switched receptacle is not specified either.

Spending a little bit of money now on a good surge protection device can save you a lot of money in the future when your equipment fails.
