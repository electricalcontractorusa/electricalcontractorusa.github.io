<p>While adding lighting outdoors is a good idea, you do need to be careful. Now that you know how to pick the perfect standby generator, you can backup your home with peace of mind. Inform kids that the only objects that go into outlets are electric plugs. If you have reason to suspect that someone who is not a Licensed Electrical Contractor (LEC) is performing electrical work, or involves an LEC not meeting the requirements of their licence, you can file a report here.</p>

This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
