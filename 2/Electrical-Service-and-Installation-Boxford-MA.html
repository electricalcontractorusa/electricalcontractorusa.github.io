Inform kids that the only objects that go into outlets are electric plugs. If you have reason to suspect that someone who is not a Licensed Electrical Contractor (LEC) is performing electrical work, or involves an LEC not meeting the requirements of their licence, you can file a report here.</p>

This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
