Low-Voltage Lighting. Because of a circuit breaker's time-delay feature, it may not need to trip for months, even years on circuits with light loads. This poses a safety issue because many old circuit breakers won't trip when they are called upon to. This could be a potential fire hazard as heat builds up possibly breaking down components of your wiring and leading to a fire.</p>
<p>Start at a landscape supply or home improvement store to buy everything you will need to install your outdoor lighting. Landscape lighting is easy to install and has a higher profit margin than almost any other landscape project.
