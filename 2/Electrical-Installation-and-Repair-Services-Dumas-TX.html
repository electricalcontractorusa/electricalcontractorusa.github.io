Power Plus provides varying scopes of service to maintain the uptime and reliability of your switchgear and ATS equipment. The smallest generators produce around 800 watts while large industrial generators can produce 500,000 watts (500 kilowatts, or kW) or more.</p>
<p>To prepare for major storms and power failures, invest in a home generator that will automatically provide power in those critical times. Before you actually start taking things apart and messing with wires, you need to shut off the power to the outlet by turning off the appropriate breaker at the breaker box. There are many projects you can take on at home without any professional assistance, but electrical wiring is not recommended for those who've never done it before.</p>

Electricians work indoors and outdoors at homes, businesses, factories, and construction sites. Avoid using electrical appliances in wet places.</p>
<p>As Figure 8 shows, electric power transmission and distribution is no longer the most important money-earning category for electrical contracting firms. Use extension cords sparingly.
