<p>You should then have the mains power turned back on, and check the voltage in your circuits. Home generators are available in two types: portable and stationery or standby generators.

Fast response to your service calls Thanks to our large staff of electricians, we are able to have an electrician at your site promptly. Our fully certified electricians will be there on time, every time, and won't stop working until everything has been returned to its normal, functional state.</p>
<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Do note that a power strip is simply an over glorified extension cord while a protector will actually protect your equipment from damage. If you want to have standby backup power for your entire house, you are going to need almost double the largest size to power most homes completely. Due to an ever-increasing requirement for improving energy conservation efforts and the importance that this initiative will have on our future and well-being, it makes sense that by using these lower voltage lights and saving more energy that you can also take part in helping with the conservation goals needed to prevent using up our valuable energy resources or to continue rapidly depleting them.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
