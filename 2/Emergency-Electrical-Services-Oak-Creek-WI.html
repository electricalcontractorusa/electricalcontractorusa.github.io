We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, all low-voltage lighting fixtures must be certified by an NRTL to pass inspection. This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
