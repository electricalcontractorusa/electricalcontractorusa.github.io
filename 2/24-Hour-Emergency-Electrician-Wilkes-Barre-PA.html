<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Our outdoor lighting contractors place your lights against a surface with the beams pointed up. This creates a shadow that illuminates the wall's or stone work's texture. The bare copper wire that is nearly black was a clue in tracking down a neutral and ground wiring failure at this building. Our lighting contractors are licensed, bonded and extremely professional. Group and label the wires in the switch boxes so you'll know how to connect them after the drywall is complete.</p>
