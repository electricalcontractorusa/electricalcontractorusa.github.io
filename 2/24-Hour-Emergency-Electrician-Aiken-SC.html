We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable.

We also provide live on-site training, tailored to each client's needs and equipment. Airing nationwide, Generac's infomercial explains why homeowners need a source of automatic backup power. I clearly remember years ago when the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) breaker was first introduced into the code.</p>

You are correct to be careful about moving outlets or any other device when the existing wires are too short.
