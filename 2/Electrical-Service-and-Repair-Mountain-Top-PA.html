<p>Electricians know the ins and outs of designing lighting systems, installing street lights and intercom systems, ensuring electrical work is up to code and repairing electrical wiring. Most modern appliances could easily overload an outdated electrical panel, which could cause issues for your home. A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>
<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance.

Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
