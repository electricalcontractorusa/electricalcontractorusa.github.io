<p>For your own safety, always unplug a lamp when you change the light bulb. Sometimes, it makes more sense to replace your panel rather than repair it. We offer both repair and replacement services , and we'll discuss the pros and cons of each option to help you make the decision that is best for your situation. Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.
