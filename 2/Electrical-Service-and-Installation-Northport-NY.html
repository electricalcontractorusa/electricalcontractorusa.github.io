Climbing a tree in contact with a power line can energize the tree with electricity and lead to electric shock or death. With a magnetic power system we are harnessing the internal force of the magnets to generate electricity. I like 12v landscape wired lighting far better then the new LED wireless lights, and I figured I'd share some of the problems I ran into that you can avoid :) Thanks for the read and the vote Kristen.</p>

<p>Milestones for the company are not a typical trait seen amongst electrical contractor websites. It's no secret that water and electricity don't mix. Tip: If none of the bulbs lights up, you may have a faulty transformer or outdoor electrical outlet. The circuit breaker sub panel can, in a sense, create new space for circuit breakers, but in a physically separate location. Constant Repairs: If you find that you're constantly needing electrical repairs, it may be time to upgrade to a newer system that is less susceptible to give you any trouble.</p>
<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
