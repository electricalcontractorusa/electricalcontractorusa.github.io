Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs. After completing this course, participants should be able to explain the basic principles of motor operation and describe the basic operation of a simple alternating current (AC) motor and a simple direct current (DC) motor.</p>
<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Businesses that take on electrical projects in multiple states may need to obtain a license in each state where they have a project. Check all the wires in each box, looking for a wire nut that perhaps has come off or should have had another wire in it. Somewhere a connection has been lost in the physical action of tugging wires around, taking them off the outlet and putting them on the new outlet. 5. Check and existing light switches and outlets to make sure they work properly.</p>
