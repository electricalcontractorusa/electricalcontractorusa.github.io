Three-way dimmers - This type of dimmer allows your lighting to be controlled by more than one switch in different locations.</p>

Whether you are home or away, a premium standby generator will keep you running during a power outage.

While Luxury Illumination has enjoyed landscape lighting project success — thanks in large part to its relationship with Coastal Source — it's a good time in general for integrators to capitalize on increasing consumer interest in both lighting and outdoor technology.</p>

One place it may go is through the electrical wiring system in your home, damaging or destroying any electrical items that are plugged in at the time. Since most surge protectors are cheap, they're worth getting (and regularly replacing) just in case. If you're building an addition onto your home or just need more outlets to meet your electrical needs, don't forget that your main electrical panel needs to be upgraded to meet your new electrical demands.</p>
