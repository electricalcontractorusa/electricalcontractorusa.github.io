<p>A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor. While most people are fine using the breaker panel that came with the home, other times problems arise and suggest an upgrade is in order. Electrical and fire safety officials warn that one misconnected wire can be deadly. Generac standby systems run an average $1,900 for a 7kW unit.

The dim lighting means you have to use more fixtures, which creates a sort of landing strip look, or if you are using deck light fixtures they end up looking like a bunch of bug zappers, (without the ability to zap the bugs). The replacement may simply involve installing a new receptacle, but it could also require replacing wires or the box as well.</p>

Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
