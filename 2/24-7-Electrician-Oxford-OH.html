<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>

While it's true that circuit breakers and fuses perform the same general function — which is to short circuit or disrupt overloaded electrical currents — it doesn't mean that they provide the equal amount of protection against electrical hazards in your home. One way you might be able to save money on the upkeep and recurring costs of your system is to use solar-powered lights.</p>
