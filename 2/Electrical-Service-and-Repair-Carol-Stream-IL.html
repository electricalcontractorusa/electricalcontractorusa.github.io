The need for surge protectors only became significant in recent years as the trend to go micro also meant the minute devices modern tech and gadgets are more sensitive to surges than the pre-internet age electrical devices. Upon completion of this course, participants should have a basic understanding of electrical troubleshooting techniques used in industry.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.

Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
