The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>

When it comes to electronic devices everyone wants their investments to be protected. According to the NEC , GFCIs are required in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and garages; and AFCIs are required in many parts of the home and sometimes the entire home, depending on the state you live in.

It's best to look for a qualified electrician before you experience a power emergency and need immediate work.</p>
<p>Article 411 was established during the 1996 National Electrical Code (NEC) cycle to provide a separate article for low-voltage lighting systems designed and listed as a complete system.

Your transformer needs to be the right wattage to accommodate the lighting you plan to install. If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
