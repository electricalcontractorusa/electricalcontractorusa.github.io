Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>

<p>The problem is that a GFCI monitors the current on the neutral and hot wires; when they are unbalanced it will trip. In new construction, GFCI receptacles are required by code where electricity and water are in close proximity, as in the bathroom, kitchen, garage, swimming pool area, crawl-space, unfinished basement, or on exterior outlets. All Coastal Source fixtures are designed to be forever serviceable. This is defined as a business, person or company employing electricians to carry out electrical installation work for profit.</p>
