Especially useful is the Solid State Lighting division.</p>
<p>If a breaker keeps tripping immediately after it's reset but the circuit's not overloaded, contact a licensed electrician immediately. If you purchase a transformer that doesn't have a photocell light sensor, you will probably be adjusting the on time about every 2 months, remember, I learned this through trial and error, it wasn't a big deal at first, but it seems to wear on me after a few years. Make sure your property is prepared for a power outage by installing a backup generator.</p>

With the performance and pricing of LED lighting, it is now an option for far more lighting applications.
