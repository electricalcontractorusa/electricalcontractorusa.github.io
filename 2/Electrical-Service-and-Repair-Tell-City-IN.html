<p>Chemical finishes, such as our classic "Matte Bronze" and "Rusty" have changed the landscape lighting world forever and are the envy of our competitors (who have been trying for years to duplicate our signature finishes). At Arrow Electric, Inc., we can provide you with a whole-house surge protection to insure your home and electronics from unpredictable power surges. There is no problem too big or small and we can handle all electrical panel problems with effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>At the same time, LED lights offer the option of brighter light to strongly illuminate certain areas. Voltage drop can occur from line loss over a long line of lights. That is exactly why we are proud to offer reliable emergency electrical services at all hours of the day. If you are ready to get whole-home surge protection installed in your home, look no further than Empowered Global. If you lose power frequently, or there is some device in your home that must remain powered on at all times for health or security reasons, then a transfer switch-equipped standby generator will virtually ensure that you have power even if you are not home when the outage occurs.</p>

Be wary of any electrical contractor who agrees to do any major electrical work, such as rewiring a house, without pulling the proper local building permits. A business could end up with an electrician who does not have the experience necessary to meet their electrical needs, or an inexperienced homeowner can end up with a contractor who takes too long and costs too much.</p>
