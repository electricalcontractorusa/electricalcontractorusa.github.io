<h3>Selecting the Right Electrical Supplies in Nitro WV</h3>
<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>These types of generators are adequate enough to power appliances such as refrigerators, furnaces, televisions, and sump pumps. Avoid planting trees underneath power lines or near utility equipment.
