The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.” With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off. If you're concerned about protecting equipment while you're away or after office hours, look for surge protectors that completely cut off the power supply after a huge spike.</p>

<p>2500-joule energy rating provides maximum protection of all your sensitive electronic devices. In order to understand which generator transfer switch is best for your installation, it's recommended to speak with a generator specialist. It was in the UK in 1881, that a Siemens AC alternator was used to light up a street electrically for the first time. Even if you turn off power, electrical wiring can be tricky and is best left to the professionals. The TLC folks promptly responded and scheduled a time to repair or replace right away.</p>
