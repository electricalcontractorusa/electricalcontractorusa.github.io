<p>These fuse boxes worked fine for small homes that didn't use much electricity, but today's electrical usage (with air conditioners, furnaces, and so on) require a higher electrical capacity. The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home.

If the main fuses remain as they are, the supplies and installation are fairly simple.
