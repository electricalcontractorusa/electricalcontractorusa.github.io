<p>Now, I'd guess this is how things are connected in the light switch box: neutral from outlet box to lights via wire nut, hot from outlet box to switch, and hot from switch to lights via wire nut. Your transformer needs to be the right wattage to accommodate the lighting you plan to install. If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>

It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
<p>If you want to install lighting fixtures in your garden or yard and design it so that it requires a constant flow of current, you need to have a current transformer that will measure the electrical current that comes into the device and distribute it to whatever lighting fixture that is connected to it.
