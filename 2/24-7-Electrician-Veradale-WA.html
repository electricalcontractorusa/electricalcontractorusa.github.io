Any damaged or frayed wiring is means for short circuiting or residential fires.

<p>Automatic transfer switches give homeowners a seamless transition of power whenever the main power is lost. This entails the same preparation as the T-connector method, except you lay the cable from the transformer, along side each light fixture (one cluster per cable), and back to the transformer. A surge protector should have protections from overheating, but if you ever feel that it's hot to the touch, replace it.
