For example, if your lights consume 100 watts of power, you'll need a power supply that's rated for at least 120 watts (100 x 1.2).

Fortunately, with the help of an emergency electrician, you can get back to normal quickly. Completely wireless and battery powered, Generac's Wireless Monitor provides you with instant status information without ever leaving the house.</p>
