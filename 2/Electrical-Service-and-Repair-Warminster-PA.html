We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable. Like a power strip, it provides extension outlets for your devices but its main job is to minimize the damage caused by random power fluctuations called power surges.</p>

Surges can be caused by birds, small animals, falling trees, or vehicles crashing into power poles, but the most obvious is lightning. Voltage indicators are pen-like pocket tools used to check for the presence of AC voltage over 50 volts. On this particular receptacle box, the black wires go with the gold screws. The reason is electrical contractors use it and most of the time in buildings and homes.</p>
