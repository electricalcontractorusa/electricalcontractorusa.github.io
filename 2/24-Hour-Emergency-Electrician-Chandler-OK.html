<p>Power generator failure can be due to a variety of causes, such as improper installation or lack of maintenance. If your electrical panel has suffered water damage, then it is time to upgrade it. For example, rust is one sign of water damage. If your old 100-amp breaker box goes kaput, Chambers recommends a 100-amp replacement because, for instance, Your stove is gas-fired, your water heater is gas, your heating is gas, and you really only need electricity for air conditioning and lights and 120-volt outlets, so a 100-amp breaker panel is plenty for a house like that," he says.</p>
