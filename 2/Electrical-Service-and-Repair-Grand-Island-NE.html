Beginning October 1, 2017, all examinations for state electrical licenses will be based on the 2017 NEC. It's a thin piece of wire designed to carry a limited electrical current. There are different types of electrical lights as well as different types of power sources, such generators, to power important equipment if the power does go out.</p>
<p>Do the same with all the black wires (and the additional 6" piece of black wire you cut in step 2). To determine exactly how much you could save with energy efficient lighting, you should begin by looking for an electrician who has experience with retrofitting. We can take care of all of your generator maintenance issues so that you can be certain that your generator will be the critical piece of backup equipment you need for any blackout or emergency.
