A bad neutral could let enough power through to run a night light, especially if it is an LED, but not enough to operate a heavy appliance.

It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>When your office's can lights die, or when it's time to replace your home's landscape lighting, you can trust Mr. Electric to tackle the job right the first time.
