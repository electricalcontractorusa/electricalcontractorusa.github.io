<h3>Questions to Ask Your Electrical Contractors in Larchmont NY</h3>
<p>Fortunately, you can protect your equipment by simply installing surge protectors where these appliances plug into your wall. When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches. A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>The panel is also set to shut off overloaded circuit breakers to prevent damaging appliances or machines and to prevent any risk of fire. This type of electrical panel has fuses that burn out, then need replacement. With our thorough electrical safety inspections , we'll be able to identify any problems or issues your system may have and repair them properly. At this point, use a voltage tester to see if the power is truly off to the light switch before you go any further.</p>
<p>Typical off the shelf models, called "point of use" protectors are the most common and are designed to safely protect only a few devices at a time. It is better to install both types, external protection, as mentioned above; and point-of-use protection, which is a single surge protector that plugs into an outlet. If you aren't sure of normal circuit wire size, use the #15 ampere Type-S time-delay fuse. A more advanced industrial electrician will be strongly involved in the control wiring and operation of process equipment.</p>
