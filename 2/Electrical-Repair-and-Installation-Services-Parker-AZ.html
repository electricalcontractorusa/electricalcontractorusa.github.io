A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>

Transformers are very convenient since they provide only a small amount of voltage to the lights as well as control the length with which the lights are turned on which allows homeowners to save up on electric bills.
