The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>
<p>At Hoffman Electrical, we provide commercial standby generator installation and repair, so your Clearwater business can stay open when your competitors can't.

<h3>What Is an Electrical Contractor? - Facts You Must Know in Massapequa Park NY</h3>
<p>Generators are sized according to wattage produced: The more watts, the bigger the unit - and the higher the price tag. Do not use extension cords or multi-outlet converters for appliances. And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors. However, by installing surge protectors where needed, you can protect the multiple pieces of equipment that share a common electric outlet.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, all low-voltage lighting fixtures must be certified by an NRTL to pass inspection. This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
<p>Make the space in the new panel for the breakers. Backup home generators can keep your most important appliances up and running from computers, fridges, and necessary medical devices. Similarly, inside box 2, attach the black wire from the three-wire bundle (black, white, copper) to the black terminal on the new switch. Unlike other maintenance and repair tasks that can be quickly fixed, when dealing with electricity it is always best to call a professional. Unfortunately, many Bergen and Hudson County homes still have outdated electrical panels or are in need of replacement for their circuit breakers and electric meters.</p>
<p>When you hire us for your home generator needs, you can feel confident knowing that we have the experience, training, and equipment necessary to provide you with the highest quality services possible. Electrical Contractor - When contracting with the public to perform electrical work an electrical contractor license is required. It also means that you don't need to use your phone to control your lights; just your existing wall switches. If all you need is a small portable 5kw generator to run the refrigerator, freezer, a few lights and power outlets, and possibly a gas furnace or small window ac unit, run extension cords or have an electrician setup your panel as needed, and call it a day.</p>
