<p>Turn OFF electricity at the main fuse box (or the circuit breaker box) that controls the power to the fixture or the room you're working in. Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‘hot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground. This is especially true if you're using a permanent standby power generator. This generator is fitted with a Vanguard V-Twin OHV engine that allows for easy conversion between liquid propane and natural gas during installation.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, all low-voltage lighting fixtures must be certified by an NRTL to pass inspection. This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
