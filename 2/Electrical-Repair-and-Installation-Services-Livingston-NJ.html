A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>

They are often equipped with timers and set up to light up important areas like doorways.

Grounded circuits are safer than ungrounded circuits. Lightning and other high-energy transient voltage surges can be suppressed with pole mounted suppressors by the utility, or with an owner supplied whole house surge protector.</p>
