A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot‚Äù current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>In most cases, two black wires will be attached to the switch's two terminal screws.
