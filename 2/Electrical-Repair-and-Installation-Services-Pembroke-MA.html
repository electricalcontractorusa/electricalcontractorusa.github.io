<p>Took about 4 days to install - including leveling a 20" grade, building a pad, drilling a brick and 8" thick concrete basement wall, transfer switch installation and gas line installation.

There are also installation standards from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) that regulate the distance between the home and the generator's footprint and different brands are equipped to be installed as close as 18 inches from the home.</p>
<p>Security garden lighting; led light installation. If you find someone that wants as much to pull a permit as to do the work, it's time to look for a new electrician. Remember, if your house electrical wiring system has no ground, properly installed GFCI receptacle WILL PROTECT YOU from electrical shock, but it will not provide grounding path for the connected equipment.

<p>Bi-fuel generators burn both natural gas and diesel at the same time in one engine. And for those of you who are still utilizing those old fashioned hanging dining fixtures that dangle with the intent of being centered over your kitchen or dining room table, it is time for those to hit the trash.

Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
