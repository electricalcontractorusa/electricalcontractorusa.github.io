<p>To install and service Generac & Honeywell generators. Don't go outside to check the damage before an electrician arrives, especially during a storm, as fallen power lines are easily concealed and can be deadly. Teach all family members to avoid touching electrical devices when they are wet, in water, or standing on a wet surface. If you are looking for a system to power your heater and one other appliance (a total of 16 circuits), purchase the 11kw generator at $3,000.</p>
<p>There are three protective devices that are designed to detect faults and quickly break the connection, helping to protect both your home from electrical fire, and your family from shock and electrocution.

The Generac standby generator senses outages and turns itself on within seconds when there's a utility power outage.</p>
<p>A circuit is a single line of wire starting at the service panel and running through the house to serve multiple outlets.
