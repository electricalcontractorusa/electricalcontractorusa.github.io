Generators come in two basic designs: standby generators and portable generators. Every house can create their own power through electric generators. With a standby Generac generator, you're never without electricity for more than a minute.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
