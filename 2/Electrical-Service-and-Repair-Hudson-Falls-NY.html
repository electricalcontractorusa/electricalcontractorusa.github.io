<p>Solar lights generally function for 8 to 10 hours. Two cables entering an outlet box indicate that the outlet is not the last fixture on a circuit. Some common sense safety precautions include making sure your hands are dry and not standing in water when performing electrical work or when accessing your electrical panel. We want all our customers to stay safe when using electricity, whether at your home, farm or office. We don't have a qualified or licensed electrician in our company hence I'm trying to get mine so i can do installation as well.</p>
