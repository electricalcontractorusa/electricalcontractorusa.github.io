We believe our customer's electrical safety is of the utmost importance and that is why we provide a FREE safety inspection with every service. Some landscape designers can be confusing when discussing angles, colors and placement of the lights. For any extended wiring circuit, always use the same size cable for the continuation.</p>

Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death.
