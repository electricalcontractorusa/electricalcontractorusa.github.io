<p>If the fixture lights, you did the job well. We have installed countless home generators for local families. Here's what Mark Earley, chief electrical engineer at the National Fire Protection Association recommends. Consider purchasing outdoor accessories with built in lighting. In this latter case, it is permitted to have 2 apprentices for each licensed electrician.
